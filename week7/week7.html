 <h2 style="margin-left: 50px">Gummy Bear and Play Button</h2>

 <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">This week, I was tasked with designing and producing something using CNC milling. I decided that the ShopBot was very useful, so I chose that to do the heavy lifting for me. For my first stab at the ShopBot, I designed a gummy bear that I could cut out of wood:</p>
 <br><img style="text-align: center;" src="bear.png" width="500" height="500" class="center">
 <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">I wasn’t content with my gummy bear. It was too small, and I returned to the drawing board to make my design more complex. So, for round two of CNC milling, I designed a YouTube play button in Fusion360 and cut it out using the ShopBot:</p>
 <br><img style="text-align: center;" src="mold.png" width="500" height="500" class="center">
 <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">My wooden cut out looked decent, so I went to the vacuum sealer to create a mold of it so I could cast it with plaster. The vacuum sealer was not a friend of mine this week, and thought it would be funny if it didn’t cooperate with me. It took me three different tries to get a decent casting, and it still was far from perfect:</p>
 <br><img style="text-align: center;" src="vacuum.png" width="500" height="500" class="center">
 <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"> Nonetheless, I mixed up some light blue plaster and poured it into the plastic mold so it would harden. The final product was very brittle, very ugly, and a good representation of “square one.”</p>

 <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">I returned to the lab a couple of days later to redesign the YouTube button. I made the triangle cut a little deeper than what it previously was and used Kassia’s expertise to perfect the vacuum sealed mold. This time, the mold turned out perfectly and I made a similar plaster mixture with the same colors and added splotches of orange on the back to look like abstract goldfish.</p>

 <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">Once the new YouTube button set, I was very pleased with the finished product and plan to give it to my brother for Christmas.</p>
