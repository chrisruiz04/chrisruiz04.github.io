<h2 style="color: #333399">For my final project ideas, I am interested in making some sort of game that I can market. </h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
<br>The first idea is a puzzle box. Puzzle boxes are a secret obsession of mine, and ever since I was young, I’ve loved escape rooms, Perplexus, and logic puzzles of all sorts. This puzzle box would take inspiration from many different puzzle boxes and combine elements to create my dream box. Consisting of wood, metal, 3D design, electronics, possible circuits/Arduino, and other mechanisms that I have yet to think of, the box itself is an ambitious task. However, I feel that I am passionate enough to make it that I will see it through.

<br>The second idea is a larger version of Battleship. The ships will be remote-controlled to set up, and there will be a claw-machine-like mechanism to select where on the grid you’d like to strike. The downside of this idea is its scale, and it would likely involve expensive Bluetooth or remote control technologies and just be too large for the lab in general.

<br>My final project proposal is actually not a game at all. It is essentially an iPod for a bike handle. Whenever I take a BlueBike out into Boston, it is always so tedious and even dangerous to have to take out my phone and change songs, fumble with my headphones to raise the volume, and repeatedly zip and unzip my pockets to access my phone. This idea is a portable device that goes around your bike handle with multiple buttons that act as an iPod shuffle. I think this is the most practical idea out of the 3, and it combines electronic circuits with Bluetooth and 3D design. I am interested more in the puzzle box, but this is definitely a good backup plan. Also, it is a very marketable idea, and I might be able to sell!
