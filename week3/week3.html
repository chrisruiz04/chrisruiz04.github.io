<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">This week, I was tasked with using Arduino and C++ to do something. I immediately thought of last week, and wanted to salvage (and finish) my imperfect cardboard carousel and use Arduino to add a song while the carousel spins.</p>
<br><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">First, I will talk about the problems I had with the carousel prototype. To start off, I knew that it was time to switch to wood. Cardboard wasn't cutting it, and the flimsiness and thinness of the cardboard gears meant that they kept shifting off of each other and the teeth wouldn't lock anmymore. So, I cut out some wooden gears with a thickness of ~1 centimeter so they would weigh themselves down and the teeth would latch. Another issue I had with the previous week is that the motor kept getting disattached from the shaft. To fix this, I custom made a shaft with a hole that was perfect for the motor, and hot glued the two together so that slippage wouldn't be  a problem. </p>

<br><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">And now, for the actual assignment: Arduino! I only have a little prior experience with Arduino, so I used the skills that I remembered to manipulate a buzzer to play the Can Can song while the carousel would spin! Here are some code snippets:</p>
<br><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">I used cardboard and wooden sticks, along with a little help from my friend hot glue, to assemble the first iteration of the carousel. </p>
