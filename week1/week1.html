<h2 style="margin-left: 50px">Cardboard Pencil Holder</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">This week, I focused on 2D design, operating a laser cutter, and creating a press fit sculpture using identical individual parts. To start, I'll begin talking through my design process for the press fit sculpture. Now, originally, when I toyed around with Fusion360 and the laser cutter, I created this ninja star shape that I really liked a lot. I even cut 2 of them and tried fitting them together:</p>

<br><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">The problem with this is that the 2 ninja stars didn't fit together because I made the notches larger than the thickness of the cardboard which is 4mm. At any rate, I decided I didn't really like the ninja star design as much and tried creating something a little bit different with circles. The second design looks more like a star of some sort and it seemed promising as well:</p>
<br><img style="text-align: center;" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E03AQGMAR8PD2fUlw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1672250872589?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=id2LR_g7BeUws_JR8EvPpEbYaZWCk_cOmzqdTLeLaAs" width="500" height="500" class="center">
<br><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">Even though it looked super cool, this time, the notches were too short and the press fit wouldn't actually fit together. So, instead of adjusting the notches a little bit, I decided to scrap the star design all together in hopes of creating a foolproof design that even <b>I</b> couldn't screw up. So, I made a hexagonal shape that I turned into a snowflake, and this idea turned out better than I could have expected!</b></p>
<br><img style="text-align: center;" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E03AQGMAR8PD2fUlw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1672250872589?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=id2LR_g7BeUws_JR8EvPpEbYaZWCk_cOmzqdTLeLaAs" width="500" height="500" class="center">
<br><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">I am very proud of what I accomplished with the laser cutter, and I even plan to bring the pencil holder to the Cambridge After School Program for the kids to store their colored pencils in. Along with the laser cutter, I also experimented a little bit with the Fusion360 software to replicate a tape roll and screwdriver, to scale.</p>
