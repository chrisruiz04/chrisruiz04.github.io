<p>This week, I was tasked with using my knowledge of digital fabrication and hand tools to create a kinetic sculpture. I wasn’t entirely sure what I wanted to create, so I took inspiration from Kassia’s dancers and started thinking about what spins. After some brainstorming, I thought that a carousel would be a good representation of a kinetic sculpture.</p>
<p>The original idea for the carousel was to have a motor connected to a gear and have the gear move another, much larger gear, with the carousel on top. Bobby advised against this idea and suggested instead that I should just attach the motor to the carousel gear to prevent the small gear from not being able to turn the much larger carousel gear. </p>
<p>So, the idea was born! I would have a large central carousel and have it connect to smaller gears with other things going on top of them.</p>
<p>I used cardboard and wooden sticks, along with a little help from my friend hot glue, to assemble the first iteration of the carousel. </p>
