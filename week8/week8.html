<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">This week was a partner week! I teamed up with <a href="https://cameronbuildsthings.github.io/PS70/">Camtastic </a>and we were tasked with using our knowledge of WiFi and Arduino programming and coding to create a device with one input and one output that would operate over WiFi. Cam suggested creating something similar to a garage door opener with a button and a DC motor, and I thought it was a great idea!</p>
<br><p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">The idea for the project is having a button on one breadboard while the other user stands across the room and once the button is pressed, a motor on their breadboard can spin via WiFi. Here are the code snippets we used for the project. We took inspiration from Rui's code on the PS70 website: </p>

<br><p>This project seems really simple, as there is only one input and one output, but figuring out how to code on both Cam's computer and my computer was pretty tricky. WiFi integration is a really cool application of Arduino, and I hope that this project helps Cam in the final!</p>
